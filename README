F5 Notifier
===========

If you ever did some crazy F5-hitting in one web page, you really know how
annoying it could be to wait for some page update.
But that time is over and now you can give your F5 key a break!

F5 Notifier watches that page and notify you if something has changed.
Get up and get yourself a nice cup of coffee and, well, wait =)

Also, you could track changes in local files and some experimental
synchronization of your configuration across your computers by saving your
settings in a Dropbox/Ubuntu One folder.


Future/TODO
===========

* Translations
* View changes dialog
* Track changes in specific parts of a file
* Security/Flooding issues
* Bugfixes
